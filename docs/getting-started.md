# Getting Started with OSA Operations

> From zero to a running AI Operation in 10 minutes.

## What Is OSA Operations?

OSA Operations is a framework for building AI-powered businesses as **portable, self-contained
directories**. Instead of writing code to build an AI company, you write markdown and YAML.
The result is an Operation -- a folder that any compatible agent runtime can pick up and run.

Think of it this way:

- **The agent is the phone.** OSA, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex -- these are runtimes.
- **The Operation is the app.** Your folder of agents, skills, workflows, and domain knowledge.
- **You are the builder.** You define what the AI company does, who it employs, and how it operates.

One repo. Every role. Any runtime.

---

## The 5-Layer Stack

Every Operation is built on 5 layers. Each layer depends only on the one below it.
You compose what you need -- not everything is required.

```
Layer 5: COMPANY     company.yaml -- mission, budget, governance, goals
Layer 4: RUNTIME     SYSTEM.md -- entry point, boot sequence, core loop
Layer 3: OPERATIONS  workflows/ -- phase pipelines, handoffs, evidence gates
Layer 2: LIBRARIES   agents/ + skills/ + reference/ -- reusable components
Layer 1: COMPUTE     Adapter layer -- OSA, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex
```

These operational layers implement the 7-layer **Optimal System** architecture from Signal Theory. The mapping is not 1:1 — operational layers group multiple theoretical concerns for practical use. The Network (L1) lives in company.yaml. The Signal (L2) lives in agent `signal:` fields. The Interface (L4) is progressive disclosure. The Feedback Loop (L6) is the heartbeat cycle. The Governance (L7) is SYSTEM.md. See `architecture/optimal-system-mapping.md` for the full mapping.

Beyond the 5-layer stack, three optional coordination formats add organizational
structure for larger operations: **teams**, **projects**, and **task manifests**.
These are not required for a working operation, but they become necessary once
your operation has 5+ agents, multiple active workstreams, or repeating work
worth codifying.

### Layer 1: Compute

The runtime that actually executes your agents. You do not build this layer --
you choose one. Options include:

| Runtime | How It Reads Your Operation |
|---------|---------------------------|
| OSA | `osa run .` -- native support, full heartbeat protocol |
| Claude Code | SYSTEM.md becomes project context, agents become behavioral modes |
| Cursor | Copy agents/ to .cursor/agents/, reference/ to .cursor/rules/ |
| Codex | Point at SYSTEM.md as system prompt, skills as tool definitions |

### Layer 2: Libraries

Reusable components that any Operation can use:

- **agents/** -- Specialist definitions (Software Architect, Outbound Prospector, etc.)
- **skills/** -- Executable commands (`/prospect`, `/build`, `/deploy`)
- **reference/** -- Domain knowledge loaded on demand (ICP frameworks, coding standards)

### Layer 3: Operations

Workflows that coordinate agents through multi-phase pipelines:

- Phase definitions with owners, evidence gates, and signal thresholds
- Handoff protocols between agents
- Retreat patterns (moving backward when quality gates fail)
- Stalled work detection

### Layer 4: Runtime

The SYSTEM.md file -- the single entry point that tells the agent who it is,
what it can do, and how to operate.

### Layer 5: Company

The organizational envelope -- mission, budget, governance, goal hierarchy.
This is what turns a collection of agents into a business.

---

## Teams, Projects, and Task Manifests

These three formats extend the core layer stack with coordination structures.
Add them when the operation grows beyond a few loosely connected agents.

### Teams — `teams/{team-id}.md`

A team groups agents by function, defines a shared budget ceiling, and documents
how members coordinate. Teams are the unit of accountability between individual
agents and the company.

```yaml
---
name: Engineering
id: engineering
manager: cto
members: [cto, backend-architect, frontend-developer, code-reviewer, sre]
budget: 3000
signal: S=(data, report, inform, markdown, sprint-status)
---
```

The body defines the team's mission, coordination patterns (who does what in what
order), escalation rules, and handoff protocols between members.

**Add a team when:**
- You have 3+ agents in the same functional area
- You want a budget ceiling for a function (not just per-agent limits)
- You want to document how agents in that function pass work to each other

See `protocol/team-format.md` for the full standard.

### Projects — `projects/{project-id}/PROJECT.md`

A project is a time-scoped workstream — weeks to months — with milestones,
a dedicated budget, and a defined owner. Projects sit between Initiatives
(in `company.yaml`) and Tasks (in `tasks/`).

```yaml
---
name: Q2 Platform Launch
id: q2-launch
owner: tech-lead
team: engineering
status: active
budget: 5000
milestones:
  - id: mvp
    name: MVP Complete
    target: 2026-04-01
    evidence_gate: tests_pass+review_approved
  - id: beta
    name: Beta Launch
    target: 2026-05-15
    evidence_gate: human_approval
---
```

The body holds project goals (measurable outcomes), resource allocation by phase,
a risk register, and open questions that must be resolved before certain milestones.

Simple operations can declare projects inline in `company.yaml` under
`goals.initiatives[].projects`. Standalone `PROJECT.md` files are for workstreams
that need detailed specs, risk tracking, or dependency management.

**Add a project when:**
- A workstream spans multiple weeks and multiple agents
- You need milestone tracking with evidence gates
- You want to allocate budget at the workstream level

See `protocol/project-format.md` for the full standard.

### Task Manifests — `tasks/manifests/{task-id}.md`

A task manifest is a reusable task definition — the permanent form of a task that
will be executed repeatedly or instantiated on a schedule. Manifests hold the
instructions, acceptance criteria, output format, and (optionally) a cron schedule.

```yaml
---
name: Monday Review
id: monday-review
assignee: ceo
project: null
priority: medium
type: recurring
schedule:
  cron: "0 9 * * 1"
  timezone: America/Chicago
evidence_gate: null
signal: S=(data, report, inform, markdown, team-status)
---
```

Manifests separate the permanent definition (what to do, how to judge it done)
from the ephemeral runtime record (who did it, when, what it cost). The runtime
instantiates a manifest into a `tasks/{ISSUE_PREFIX}-{n}.yaml` record each time
the schedule fires or the manifest is triggered.

**Add a task manifest when:**
- A task recurs on a schedule (weekly reviews, daily digests, sprint kickoffs)
- A task pattern is used across multiple projects (code reviews, health checks)
- You want to codify the instructions and acceptance criteria for a category of work

See `protocol/task-format.md` for the full standard.

### How They Fit Together

```
company.yaml             ← Mission, budget, governance, Initiatives
  └── teams/engineering.md    ← Team: budget ceiling + coordination patterns
       └── agents/cto.md      ← Agent: role, skills, signal encoding
       └── agents/backend-architect.md
  └── projects/q2-launch/PROJECT.md  ← Project: milestones, risks, owner
       └── tasks/ACM-001.yaml        ← Ephemeral task (runtime-created)
       └── tasks/manifests/code-review.md  ← Reusable task definition
```

None of these formats depend on the others to function. A project can exist
without a team. A task manifest can exist without a project. Add each one
when the operation needs it, not before.

## Your First Operation in 10 Minutes

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/optimalos/osa-operations.git
cd osa-operations
```

### Step 2: Copy an Example

```bash
cp -r operations/dev-shop my-operation
cd my-operation
```

### Step 3: Edit company.yaml

Open `company.yaml` and change it to match your business:

```yaml
name: My AI Startup
slug: my-ai-startup
description: AI-powered code review service for SaaS companies.
mission: Ship zero-bug releases through automated, context-aware code review.

budget:
  monthly_usd: 3000
  per_agent_usd: 600
  enforcement: warning

governance:
  board_approval_required:
    - new_agent_hire
    - budget_increase_pct: 20
  immutable_log: true
  escalation_chain:
    - tech-lead
    - board

issue_prefix: "MAS-"
```

### Step 4: Pick Your Agents

Browse the agent library and copy the ones you need:

```bash
# See what's available
ls ../agents/technology/
ls ../agents/revenue/

# Copy the ones you want
cp ../agents/technology/software-engineering/application-development/code-reviewer.md agents/
cp ../agents/technology/software-engineering/core-architecture/software-architect.md agents/
cp ../agents/technology/platform-infrastructure/security-engineering/security-engineer.md agents/
```

### Step 5: Customize SYSTEM.md

Edit SYSTEM.md to reflect your operation. The critical sections:

```markdown
# My AI Startup -- Agent System Instructions

## Identity
You are operating **My AI Startup** -- an automated code review service...

## Boot Sequence
1. Load reference/standards.md (coding standards)
2. Load reference/patterns.md (review patterns)

## Core Loop
RECEIVE code change
  > CLASSIFY: what type of review?
  > ROUTE: activate the right reviewer agent
  > ACT: perform the review
  > VERIFY: does the review meet quality gates?
  > PERSIST: log results, update metrics

## Available Agents
| Agent | Role | Activate When |
|-------|------|---------------|
| code-reviewer | Primary Reviewer | Any PR submitted |
| software-architect | Architecture Review | Structural changes |
| security-engineer | Security Review | Auth, data, API changes |

## Available Skills
| Skill | Command | What It Does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Review | `/review <PR>` | Full code review |
```

### Step 6: Add Domain Knowledge

Create reference files for your specific domain:

```bash
mkdir -p reference
```

Write `reference/standards.md` with your coding standards.
Write `reference/patterns.md` with review patterns to check for.

### Step 7: Run It

```bash
# With OSA (native)
osa run .

# With Claude Code (use SYSTEM.md as project context)
cd my-operation
# Claude Code reads SYSTEM.md automatically

# With Cursor
cp agents/* .cursor/agents/
# Reference SYSTEM.md in your cursor rules
```

## Running an Operation with Different Runtimes

### OSA (Native Runtime)

OSA implements the full Workspace Protocol: heartbeat execution, budget enforcement,
session persistence, governance, and the task system.

```bash
# Start the operation
osa run .

# The heartbeat protocol kicks in:
# 1. Reads SYSTEM.md
# 2. Discovers agents/ and skills/
# 3. Loads boot sequence
# 4. Enters core loop
# 5. Agents wake on schedule or assignment
```

### Claude Code

Claude Code reads SYSTEM.md as project context. Agents become behavioral modes
that Claude adopts based on the task at hand.

```bash
# Navigate to your operation directory
cd my-operation

# Claude Code automatically detects SYSTEM.md
# You interact naturally:
#   "Review this PR" -> activates code-reviewer agent behavior
#   "Design the API" -> activates software-architect agent behavior
#   "/build user-auth" -> executes the build skill
```

Limitations with Claude Code:
- No automatic heartbeat (agent runs on your prompts, not on schedule)
- No budget enforcement (you manage costs manually)
- No persistent sessions across conversations (session state resets)
- Skills execute as tool sequences within the conversation

### Cursor

Cursor uses agent files as rule sets. Copy agents into `.cursor/agents/`
and reference files into `.cursor/rules/`.

```bash
cp agents/* .cursor/agents/
cp reference/* .cursor/rules/
```

### Any Other Runtime

Any agent that can:
1. Read a markdown file (SYSTEM.md)
2. Discover files in a directory (agents/, skills/)
3. Execute tool sequences

...can run an Operation. The Workspace Protocol is runtime-agnostic by design.

### Sales Engine (`operations/sales-engine/`)
A B2B SaaS sales operation. 5 agents (director, prospector, closer, researcher,
copywriter). 7-phase deal cycle from prospect to closed-won. Budget: $5,000/month.

### Content Factory (`operations/content-factory/`)
A content production operation. Agents for editorial, writing, SEO, and social media.
Workflows for content ideation through multi-platform publishing. Budget: $4,000/month.

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need all 5 layers?**
No. An agent file works without a company. A company works without workflows.
Start with SYSTEM.md + a few agents. Add layers as you need them.

**Q: Can I mix agents from different examples?**
Yes. Agents are portable. Copy a sales agent into a dev operation if you need it.
Just update SYSTEM.md to reference the new agent.

**Q: What if my runtime does not support the full protocol?**
Use what it supports. Claude Code does not have heartbeats, but it reads SYSTEM.md
and can follow agent definitions. The protocol degrades gracefully.

**Q: How much does it cost to run an Operation?**
Depends on your runtime and usage. The budget system in company.yaml lets you set
hard ceilings. A typical dev-shop Operation running on Claude Code costs $100-500/month
in API calls depending on volume.

**Q: Can I sell my Operation?**
Yes. An Operation is a self-contained directory. Package it, distribute it, license it.
The marketplace spec in `architecture/marketplace.md` defines the bundle format.
