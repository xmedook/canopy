# Canopy

![Canopy Command Center](desktop/static/canopy-screenshot.png)

> Open-source workspace protocol and command center for AI agent systems.
> Build autonomous AI companies — not chatbots.

Canopy is a workspace protocol that turns folders of markdown into fully operational AI companies. Define agents, skills, teams, budgets, and governance in plain files — then connect any AI backend (Claude Code, OSA, Codex, Gemini, Cursor) and watch them work autonomously on heartbeat schedules.

The desktop command center gives you a native app to hire from 160+ agents, watch them collaborate in a pixel-art virtual office, monitor token costs in real-time, and intervene when needed.

**Manage AI systems, not prompts.**

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install and launch in one command
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Miosa-osa/canopy/main/install.sh | bash
```

Installs prerequisites, clones the repo, sets up the database, and opens the app.

```bash
# Already cloned? Manual setup
cd canopy && make setup && make dev
```

```bash
# Just want the protocol? No app needed
cd canopy/operations/sales-engine
# Claude Code, Cursor, OSA, Codex — any agent reads SYSTEM.md and starts working
```

---

## How It Works

| Step | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **01** | Pick a workspace: `sales-engine/`, `dev-shop/`, `content-factory/`, `cognitive-os/`, or build your own |
| **02** | Connect your agent: Claude Code, OSA, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Aider, Windsurf, or OpenClaw |
| **03** | Run: agent reads `SYSTEM.md`, discovers skills and specialists, operates autonomously |

**If it can read markdown, it's hired.**

## Features

### Workspace Protocol

The Canopy workspace is a folder of plain markdown files. No proprietary server, no lock-in. The directory structure is the architecture:

```
L0  SYSTEM.md + company.yaml          Always loaded (~2K tokens)
L1  agents/ + skills/                 On-demand (~2K tokens per item)
L2  reference/ + workflows/ + spec/   Deep context (full content, via search)
L3  engine/                           Invisible (0 tokens, powers skills)
```

`SYSTEM.md` is the entry point: identity, boot sequence, core loop, skills list, agents list, routing table, and handoff protocol — approximately 120 lines that define the entire operating system.

`company.yaml` carries mission, budget, governance rules, org chart, and goal hierarchy with evidence gates.

### Progressive Disclosure

Every entity — agents, skills, teams, projects, tasks — exposes itself in three tiers. The agent requests only what it needs, when it needs it.

```
Tier 0 (Catalog)     Name + one-line description only. ~100 tokens per entity.
Tier 1 (Activation)  Full manifest body loaded on demand. ~2K tokens per entity.
Tier 2 (Full)        All referenced assets: scripts, linked docs, evidence schemas.
```

The catalog is always cheap. Full manifests cost only when actually used. This achieves 96% context reduction versus systems that load everything upfront.

### Agent Hiring

Browse and hire from a library of 160+ pre-built agents across 13 categories — or define your own in a markdown file. Agents are behavioral templates, not binaries.

Each agent file defines role, tools, coordination rules, escalation path, and heartbeat behavior. One-click hire from the Command Center or drop the file into `agents/`.

### Heartbeat Protocol

Agents wake on schedule, check for work, execute, and delegate autonomously.

```
Agent wakes (schedule, task assignment, or mention)
  -> Retrieves identity and role
  -> Checks pending approvals
  -> Fetches assigned tasks (sorted by priority)
  -> Atomic checkout (prevents double-work)
  -> Executes task
  -> Comments on progress
  -> Delegates subtasks to reports
  -> Sleeps until next heartbeat
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination

Tasks are the communication protocol. No agent-to-agent messaging required.

- **Delegation** — create a child task assigned to a report
- **Status** — modify task fields
- **Escalation** — traverse parent chain up to orchestrator
- **Atomic checkout** — only one agent works on a task at a time (409 = move on)

Task hierarchy: Initiatives -> Projects -> Milestones -> Issues -> Sub-issues. Every task traces back to a company goal.

### Budget Enforcement

Three tiers — visibility, soft alert, hard ceiling:

| Threshold | Behavior |
|-----------|---------|
| Always | Dashboard shows spend per agent, task, project, goal |
| 80% | Soft alert — agent warned to focus on critical tasks only |
| 100% | Hard stop — auto-pause, approval required to resume |

Tracks tokens and dollars. Rollup at any level. Enforced at every execution boundary — scheduler, manual invoke, task checkout.

### Governance

You operate as the board of directors:

- Agents cannot hire new agents without your approval
- Strategy proposals require board review before execution
- Budget overrides require explicit authorization
- Every action logged in an immutable audit trail
- Approval states: `pending` -> `approved` / `rejected` / `revision requested`

### Session Persistence

Agents resume context across heartbeats instead of starting fresh:

- Task-scoped sessions persist across invocations
- When context fills, generate handoff summary and start fresh
- Compaction policy: max runs, max tokens, max age
- Agent never loses progress — compacts and continues

### Multi-Runtime Adapter Dispatch

One orchestrator dispatches work to different runtimes based on task type:

```
/delegate "Write the API spec"    -> Claude Code (deep reasoning)
/delegate "Refactor 50 files"     -> Codex (bulk code changes)
/delegate "Analyze screenshots"   -> Gemini (multimodal)
/delegate "Run test suite"        -> Shell process
/delegate "Check production"      -> HTTP webhook
```

Each runtime is a pluggable adapter behind a standard interface.

### Agent Commerce

Agents can buy things. Stripe's Machine Payments Protocol (MPP) lets agents transact autonomously — pay for APIs, buy compute, purchase services from other agent workspaces.

Canopy's budget enforcement wraps around MPP:

- **Under threshold** — agent pays autonomously, logged to budget
- **Over threshold** — payment queued for human approval
- **Over budget** — hard stop, no payment authorized

### Manifest Types

**`TEAM.md`** — Defines an org subtree. Teams group agents, own a shared budget slice, and declare their coordination protocol.

**`PROJECT.md`** — Defines planned work with milestones, budget allocation, and resource assignments. Carries explicit evidence gates.

**`TASK.md`** — Portable, reusable task definition. Assigned to agents, tracked through the task hierarchy.

Canopy dispatches work to any connected runtime. Ten adapters supported out of the box:

| Adapter | Install |
|---------|---------|
| **OSA** | `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Miosa-osa/OSA/main/install.sh \| bash` |
| **Claude Code** | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| **Codex** | `npm install -g @openai/codex` |
| **Cursor** | [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh) |
| **Gemini** | [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev) |
| **Aider** | `pip install aider-chat` |
| **Windsurf** | [codeium.com/windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf) |
| **OpenClaw** | `npm install -g openclaw` |
| **JidoClaw** | `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertohluna/jido_claw/main/install.sh \| bash` |

## Theoretical Foundation

Canopy implements the **Optimal System** architecture from *Signal Theory: The Architecture of Optimal Intent Encoding* (MIOSA Research, 2026). The protocol's directory structure, agent format, progressive disclosure, and governance model directly implement the paper's 7-layer system:

1. **Network** — `company.yaml` and `reportsTo` define who connects to whom
2. **Signal** — `S=(M,G,T,F,W)` encodes intent across 5 dimensions
3. **Composition** — Agent body sections and skill steps define micro-structure
4. **Interface** — Progressive disclosure (L0/L1/L2) surfaces the right context
5. **Data** — Markdown files are the storage substrate for organizational intent
6. **Feedback** — Heartbeat cycles and quality gates close every loop
7. **Governance** — `SYSTEM.md` encodes Beer's Viable System Model recursively

Every design decision traces to one of four governing principles: **Shannon** (channel capacity), **Ashby** (requisite variety), **Beer** (viable structure), **Wiener** (feedback closure).

## Ecosystem

```
Canopy (protocol)   ->  Any agent reads it. Free. MIT license.
Command Center      ->  Native desktop app. Free. Open source.

```

Canopy is the open-source foundation. [MIOSA](https://miosa.ai) provides managed infrastructure, a marketplace for buying and selling agent workspaces, and enterprise governance tools built on top of the same protocol.
