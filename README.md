# Canopy

![Canopy Command Center](desktop/static/canopy-screenshot.png)

> Open-source workspace protocol and command center for AI agent systems.
> Build autonomous AI companies — not chatbots.

Canopy is a workspace protocol that turns folders of markdown into fully operational AI companies. Define agents, skills, teams, budgets, and governance in plain files — then connect any AI backend (Claude Code, OSA, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, Aider, Windsurf) and watch them work autonomously on heartbeat schedules.

The desktop command center gives you a native app to hire from 330+ agents, watch them collaborate in a pixel-art virtual office, monitor token costs in real-time, and intervene when needed.

**Manage AI systems, not prompts.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install and launch in one command
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Miosa-osa/canopy/main/install.sh | bash
```

Installs prerequisites, clones the repo, sets up the database, and opens the app.

```bash
# Already cloned? Manual setup
cd canopy && make setup && make dev
```

```bash
# Just want the protocol? No app needed
cd canopy/operations/sales-engine
# Claude Code, Cursor, OSA, Codex — any agent reads SYSTEM.md and starts working
```

---

## How It Works

| Step | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **01** | Pick a workspace: `sales-engine/`, `dev-shop/`, `content-factory/`, `cognitive-os/`, or build your own |
| **02** | Connect your agent: Claude Code, OSA, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Aider, Windsurf, or OpenClaw |
| **03** | Run: agent reads `SYSTEM.md`, discovers skills and specialists, operates autonomously |

**If it can read markdown, it's hired.**

## Features

### Workspace Protocol

The Canopy workspace is a folder of plain markdown files. No proprietary server, no lock-in. The directory structure is the architecture:

```
L0  SYSTEM.md + company.yaml          Always loaded (~2K tokens)
L1  agents/ + skills/                 On-demand (~2K tokens per item)
L2  reference/ + workflows/ + spec/   Deep context (full content, via search)
L3  engine/                           Invisible (0 tokens, powers skills)
```

`SYSTEM.md` is the entry point: identity, boot sequence, core loop, skills list, agents list, routing table, and handoff protocol — approximately 120 lines that define the entire operating system.

`company.yaml` carries mission, budget, governance rules, org chart, and goal hierarchy with evidence gates.

### Progressive Disclosure

Every entity — agents, skills, teams, projects, tasks — exposes itself in three tiers. The agent requests only what it needs, when it needs it.

```
Tier 0 (Catalog)     Name + one-line description only. ~100 tokens per entity.
Tier 1 (Activation)  Full manifest body loaded on demand. ~2K tokens per entity.
Tier 2 (Full)        All referenced assets: scripts, linked docs, evidence schemas.
```

The catalog is always cheap. Full manifests cost only when actually used. This achieves 96% context reduction versus systems that load everything upfront.

### Agent Hiring

Browse and hire from a library of 330+ pre-built agents across 19 categories — or define your own in a markdown file. Agents are behavioral templates, not binaries.

Each agent file defines role, tools, coordination rules, escalation path, and heartbeat behavior. One-click hire from the Command Center or drop the file into `agents/`.

### Heartbeat Protocol

Agents wake on schedule, check for work, execute, and delegate autonomously. The heartbeat is a 9-step GenServer cycle with atomic checkout, governance gate checks, and session continuity:

```
Agent wakes (schedule, task assignment, or mention)
  -> Retrieves identity and role
  -> Checks governance gates (pending approvals block execution)
  -> Loads continuation context from previous session
  -> Resolves adapter (override → content router → agent default)
  -> Fetches assigned tasks (sorted by priority)
  -> Atomic checkout (prevents double-work)
  -> Executes via resolved adapter
  -> Comments on progress, delegates subtasks
  -> Compacts session (summary + handoff for next heartbeat)
  -> Sleeps until next heartbeat
```

### Session Persistence & Continuity

Agents resume context across heartbeats instead of starting cold:

- **Session chains** — linked sessions with `parent_session_id` and `sequence_number` tracking full execution history
- **Automatic compaction** — after each heartbeat, the Compactor extracts structured facts (tools used, errors, outputs, decisions) into a summary
- **Handoff generation** — markdown handoff document with pending items, key decisions, blockers, and continuation state
- **Cross-heartbeat injection** — next heartbeat loads the previous session's handoff as context preamble
- **Chain queries** — `GET /sessions/:id/chain` returns full session lineage with cumulative token usage
- **Manual compaction** — `POST /sessions/:id/compact` triggers on-demand summarization

### Multi-Agent Coordination

Tasks are the communication protocol. No agent-to-agent messaging required.

- **Delegation** — create a child task assigned to a report, with adapter-aware routing
- **Status** — modify task fields
- **Escalation** — traverse parent chain up to orchestrator
- **Atomic checkout** — only one agent works on a task at a time (409 = move on)

Task hierarchy: Initiatives → Projects → Milestones → Issues → Sub-issues. Every task traces back to a company goal.

### Dynamic Adapter Dispatch

One orchestrator dispatches work to different runtimes based on task content. The dispatch router uses a three-tier priority waterfall:

```
1. Task adapter_override   (explicit per-task)
2. Content-based routing   (label + regex matching)
3. Agent default adapter   (fallback)
```

Content patterns route automatically:

```
/delegate "Write the API spec"    → Claude Code (deep reasoning)
/delegate "Refactor 50 files"     → Codex (bulk code changes)
/delegate "Analyze screenshots"   → Gemini (multimodal)
/delegate "Run test suite"        → Bash (shell process)
/delegate "Check production"      → HTTP (webhook)
```

The delegation system creates subtasks with automatic adapter selection, finding idle agents that match the inferred adapter type. Preview endpoint available at `POST /dispatch/preview` for dry-run routing.

### Budget Enforcement

Three tiers — visibility, soft alert, hard ceiling:

| Threshold | Behavior |
|-----------|---------|
| Always | Dashboard shows spend per agent, task, project, goal |
| 80% | Soft alert — agent warned to focus on critical tasks only |
| 100% | Hard stop — auto-pause, approval required to resume |

Tracks tokens and dollars. Rollup at any level (agent, team, department, division, organization). Enforced at every execution boundary — scheduler, manual invoke, task checkout. ETS atomic counters for lock-free performance.

### Governance Gates

Approval enforcement integrated into the controller pipeline:

- **Spawn gate** — agents cannot be created without approval (configurable per workspace)
- **Delete gate** — agent termination requires authorization
- **Budget override gate** — exceeding limits requires explicit approval
- **Strategy gate** — proposals require board review before execution
- **Heartbeat blocking** — agents with pending approvals are blocked from execution
- **Auto-execution** — approved actions replay automatically via the Executor
- **Idempotent** — duplicate pending approvals are deduplicated

Governance is a Phoenix plug (`CanopyWeb.Plugs.Governance`) that halts with HTTP 202 when an action requires approval. The workspace's `governance` config determines which actions need approval and which roles are auto-approved.

```
POST /spawn  →  Governance plug  →  Gate.check(:spawn_agent)
                                      |
                         requires_approval?  →  yes  →  202 {pending_approval}
                                             →  no   →  :allowed (continue)
```

### Organizational Hierarchy

Five-layer structure with cascading budgets:

```
Organization (billing entity, governance config)
  └── Division (business unit, head agent, budget)
        └── Department (functional area, head agent, budget)
              └── Team (execution unit, manager agent, budget)
                    └── Agent (individual worker, budget)
```

Full CRUD at every level. `GET /hierarchy?organization_id=X` returns the complete tree assembled from flat queries. Team memberships tracked via join table with role assignment.

### Workflow Engine

DAG-based workflow execution with 7 step types:

| Step Type | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| `agent_task` | Assign work to a specific agent |
| `approval` | Block until human approves |
| `condition` | Branch based on previous step output |
| `transform` | Reshape data between steps |
| `webhook` | Call external HTTP endpoint |
| `delay` | Wait for specified duration |
| `parallel` | Execute multiple steps concurrently |

Workflows support:
- Topological sort for dependency resolution
- Retry with configurable backoff (constant, linear, exponential)
- Cron-based scheduled execution via `Canopy.Workflows.Scheduler`
- Step-level status tracking (pending → running → completed/failed/skipped)
- OTP supervision for fault tolerance

### Agent Commerce _(Planned — requires Stripe MPP integration)_

Agents will be able to buy things. Stripe's Machine Payments Protocol (MPP) lets agents transact autonomously — pay for APIs, buy compute, purchase services from other agent workspaces.

Canopy's budget enforcement will wrap around MPP:

- **Under threshold** — agent pays autonomously, logged to budget
- **Over threshold** — payment queued for human approval
- **Over budget** — hard stop, no payment authorized

### Manifest Types

**`TEAM.md`** — Defines an org subtree. Teams group agents, own a shared budget slice, and declare their coordination protocol.

**`PROJECT.md`** — Defines planned work with milestones, budget allocation, and resource assignments. Carries explicit evidence gates.

**`TASK.md`** — Portable, reusable task definition. Assigned to agents, tracked through the task hierarchy.

## Theoretical Foundation

Canopy implements the **Optimal System** architecture from *Signal Theory: The Architecture of Optimal Intent Encoding* (MIOSA Research, 2026). The protocol's directory structure, agent format, progressive disclosure, and governance model directly implement the paper's 7-layer system:

1. **Network** — `company.yaml` and `reportsTo` define who connects to whom
2. **Signal** — `S=(M,G,T,F,W)` encodes intent across 5 dimensions
3. **Composition** — Agent body sections and skill steps define micro-structure
4. **Interface** — Progressive disclosure (L0/L1/L2) surfaces the right context
5. **Data** — Markdown files are the storage substrate for organizational intent
6. **Feedback** — Heartbeat cycles and quality gates close every loop
7. **Governance** — `SYSTEM.md` encodes Beer's Viable System Model recursively

Every design decision traces to one of four governing principles: **Shannon** (channel capacity), **Ashby** (requisite variety), **Beer** (viable structure), **Wiener** (feedback closure).
