# Canopy

> Open-source workspace protocol for AI agent systems.
> If OSA/ Claude Code is the employee, Canopy is the office.

Canopy is a folder structure that turns any AI agent into a specialist. Point Claude,
Codex, Cursor, Gemini, or any agent at a Canopy workspace — it reads the
SYSTEM.md, discovers the skills, loads the agents, and starts working. No server.
No database. No lock-in. Just folders of markdown files.

It looks like a bunch of markdown — but underneath it has org charts, budgets,
governance, heartbeats, tiered context loading, knowledge graphs, and multi-agent
coordination.

**Manage AI systems, not prompts.**

| Step | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **01** Pick a workspace | `sales-engine/`, `dev-shop/`, `content-factory/`, `cognitive-os/`, or build your own |
| **02** Connect your agent | Claude Code, OSA, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Aider, Windsurf, OpenClaw, or any agent |
| **03** Run | Agent reads SYSTEM.md, discovers skills and specialists, operates autonomously |

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Miosa-osa/canopy.git
cd canopy/operations/sales-engine

# Claude Code: reads SYSTEM.md automatically
# OSA: osa connect .
# Cursor: ./scripts/install.sh --tool cursor
# Any agent: read SYSTEM.md, run skills via shell
```

## Works With

| | | | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | **Codex** | **Cursor** | **Gemini** | **OSA** | **OpenClaw** | **Aider** | **Windsurf** |

Plus OpenCode, HTTP endpoints, shell processes, and any agent that can read files.

**If it can read markdown, it's hired.**

## The Command Center: OSA

Canopy is the protocol. **OSA** (Optimal System Agent) is the visual command center.

While Canopy works perfectly from the terminal, OSA gives you a GUI to manage
everything — think of it as the control tower for your agent fleet:

- **Workspace Dashboard** — See all your Canopy workspaces in one view. Status,
  active agents, budget burn, recent activity. Click into any workspace to inspect.
- **Org Chart** — Visual hierarchy of your agent team. Who reports to whom,
  current assignments, workload distribution. Drag to reassign. Click to inspect.
- **Agent Terminal** — Live agent sessions. Watch agents work in real-time,
  intervene when needed, approve decisions inline. Multiple terminals side by side.
- **Project Board** — Initiatives → Projects → Milestones → Issues. Kanban or
  timeline view. Auto-populated from workspace task files.
- **Budget Console** — Token spend, dollar costs, per-workspace and per-agent
  breakdowns. Alerts, forecasts, hard ceiling controls.
- **Skill Library** — Browse, install, and configure skills across workspaces.
  Preview skill definitions, test runs, version history.
- **App Integrations** — Connect workspaces to external tools (CRM, email, Slack,
  calendars, databases). Visual configuration, credential management, webhook setup.
- **Marketplace** — Browse community workspaces, agent templates, and skill packs.
  One-click install into any workspace.

```

**OSA is open source too.** The CLI works standalone. The GUI is for people who want
to see their agent empire at a glance. Both read the same Canopy workspace files.

Want just the protocol? Use Canopy with any terminal agent.
Want the full experience? Use OSA for the visual layer + Canopy for the workspace.
Want managed infrastructure? Use [MIOSA](#canopy--miosa) for VMs + scaling + marketplace.

```
Canopy (protocol)  →  Any agent reads it. Free. MIT license.
OSA (GUI)          →  Visual command center. Free. Open source.
MIOSA (platform)   →  Managed VMs, marketplace, enterprise. Paid.
```

## Canopy is right for you if

- You want to build autonomous AI companies, agencies, or workflows
- You coordinate multiple agents (Claude, Codex, Cursor, Gemini) toward a common goal
- You have 20 agent terminals open and lose track of what everyone is doing
- You want agents running on heartbeats 24/7, but still want to audit and override
- You want to build a second brain, knowledge system, or cognitive OS with AI
- You want to monitor costs and enforce budgets across agent teams
- You want pre-built workspaces you can download and run in 5 minutes
- You want a workspace protocol that isn't locked to one vendor's server
- You want your AI company to actually build apps, products, and integrations — not just chat
- You want an org chart, project board, and budget console for your agent teams
- You want to automate RPA workflows, browser tasks, and multi-step processes with natural language

## Features

### Tiered Context Loading

The folder structure IS the context architecture. Layer 0 is what the agent reads
first. Each layer deeper costs more tokens and loads only when needed.

```
L0: SYSTEM.md + company.yaml        Always loaded (~2K tokens)
L1: agents/ + skills/                On-demand (~2K tokens per item)
L2: reference/ + workflows/ + spec/  Deep context (full content, via search)
L3: engine/                          Invisible (0 tokens, powers skills)
```

No other system does this. Traditional agent frameworks dump everything into the prompt.
File-based systems use ripgrep on flat directories. Canopy loads context in tiers —
abstracts first, summaries on-demand, full content only when needed. 96% cost reduction
vs traditional RAG.

### Heartbeat Protocol

Agents wake on schedule, check for work, execute, and delegate — autonomously.

```
Agent wakes (schedule, task assignment, or mention)
  → Retrieves identity and role
  → Checks pending approvals
  → Fetches assigned tasks (sorted by priority)
  → Atomic checkout (prevents double-work)
  → Executes task
  → Comments on progress (always, before exiting)
  → Delegates subtasks to reports
  → Sleeps until next heartbeat
```

See [`architecture/heartbeat.md`](architecture/heartbeat.md) for the full 9-step protocol.

### Multi-Runtime Adapter Registry

One orchestrator dispatches work to different runtimes based on task type:

```
/delegate "Write the API spec"    → Claude Code (deep reasoning)
/delegate "Refactor 50 files"     → Codex (bulk code changes)
/delegate "Analyze screenshots"   → Gemini (multimodal)
/delegate "Run test suite"        → Shell process
/delegate "Check production"      → HTTP webhook
```

Each runtime is a pluggable adapter behind a standard interface. New runtime?
Write one adapter. Register it. Done.

See [`architecture/adapters.md`](architecture/adapters.md).

### Budget Enforcement

Three tiers — visibility, soft alert, hard ceiling:

| Threshold | What Happens |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Always** | Dashboard shows spend per agent, task, project, goal |
| **80%** | Soft alert — agent warned to focus on critical tasks only |
| **100%** | Hard stop — auto-pause, approval required to resume |

Tracks tokens and dollars. Rollup at any level. Enforced at every execution
boundary — scheduler, manual invoke, task checkout.

See [`architecture/budgets.md`](architecture/budgets.md).

### Agent Commerce (Machine Payments Protocol)

Agents don't just do work — they **buy things**. Stripe's Machine Payments Protocol
(MPP) lets agents transact autonomously: pay for APIs, buy compute, purchase services
from other agent workspaces.

```
Agent needs browser sessions for scraping
  → Hits Browserbase API
  → Gets payment request back (MPP)
  → Checks budget (Canopy governance)
  → Authorizes payment (within threshold)
  → Receives resource
  → Spend logged to workspace budget
```

Canopy's budget enforcement + governance gates wrap around MPP:
- **Under threshold** — agent pays autonomously, logged to budget
- **Over threshold** — payment queued for human approval
- **Over budget** — hard stop, no payment authorized

This is how autonomous companies actually work. Agents buying from agents.
Your sales workspace pays for lead data. Your dev workspace pays for compute.
Your content workspace pays for stock images. All within governed budgets.

### Governance & Approval Gates

You operate as the board of directors:

- Agents can't hire new agents without your approval
- Strategy proposals require board review before execution
- Budget overrides require explicit authorization
- Every action logged in an immutable audit trail
- Approval states: pending → approved / rejected / revision requested

See [`architecture/governance.md`](architecture/governance.md).

### Task Coordination

Tasks ARE the communication protocol. No agent-to-agent messaging:

- **Delegation** = create child task assigned to a report
- **Status** = modify task fields
- **Escalation** = traverse parent chain up to orchestrator
- **Atomic checkout** = only one agent works on a task at a time (409 = move on)

Hierarchy: Initiatives → Projects → Milestones → Issues → Sub-issues.
Every task traces back to a company goal.

See [`architecture/tasks.md`](architecture/tasks.md).

### Session Persistence & Compaction

Agents resume context across heartbeats instead of starting fresh:

- Task-scoped sessions persist across invocations
- When context fills, generate handoff summary + start fresh
- Compaction policy: max runs, max tokens, max age
- Agent never loses progress — just compacts and continues

See [`architecture/sessions.md`](architecture/sessions.md).

### 6R Knowledge Pipeline

For knowledge workspaces (second brains, cognitive OS):

```
Record (capture) → Reduce (extract insights)
  → Reflect (discover connections) → Reweave (update older content)
    → Verify (quality gate) → Rethink (evolve the system)
```

Each phase can spawn a fresh subagent for clean context. Per-note task files
serve as inter-phase communication. Three depths: Deep, Standard, Quick.

See [`architecture/processing-pipeline.md`](architecture/processing-pipeline.md).

### Multi-Agent Team Coordination

Spawn teams of agents that coordinate via filesystem:

- **Inbox messaging** — file-based, atomic writes, consume or peek
- **Git worktree isolation** — each agent gets its own branch, no conflicts
- **Task dependencies** — auto-unblock when upstream completes
- **Team templates** — YAML/TOML archetypes for repeatable setups
- **Liveness detection** — dead agents auto-release locks

See [`architecture/team-coordination.md`](architecture/team-coordination.md).

### Cross-Workspace Signals

Workspaces communicate through signals with universal encoding:
**S = (Mode, Genre, Type, Format, Structure)**

```
Sales agent closes a deal
  → Signal routes to Content Factory (case study material)
  → Signal routes to Cognitive OS (revenue tracking)
  → Each workspace decodes using its own context
```

Same signal, different receiver, different genre. A salesperson gets a brief.
A developer gets a spec. A CEO gets a decision log.

See [`architecture/cross-workspace-signals.md`](architecture/cross-workspace-signals.md).

Run an entire AI company from a workspace:

```

│   ├── content-factory.yaml
│   └── support-ops.yaml
└── engine/                       Goal tracking, budget ledger, signal bus
```

The orchestrator doesn't do domain work. It coordinates the workspaces that do.

## Agent Config + Workspace = Specialized System

Every agent runtime has a base configuration. When it enters a Canopy workspace,
the workspace layers on top — doesn't replace, extends:

```
Base config (always active):              Workspace (added on entry):
  ~/.claude/                               sales-engine/
  ├── agents/ (debugger, reviewer)         ├── agents/ (closer, prospector)
  ├── commands/ (/commit, /test)           ├── skills/ (/qualify, /pipeline)
  ├── rules/ (coding standards)            ├── reference/ (ICP, MEDDPICC)
  └── hooks/ (automation)                  └── engine/ (CRM integration)

= A fully equipped sales agent that can also debug code
```

When the agent leaves and enters a different workspace, it drops the sales
context and picks up whatever the new workspace provides. Base config persists.

| Runtime | Base Config | How Workspace Layers On |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/` | Reads SYSTEM.md as project CLAUDE.md |
| **OSA** | `~/.osa/` | `osa connect .` auto-discovers everything |
| **Cursor** | `.cursor/` | SYSTEM.md → `.cursorrules`, agents → project rules |
| **Windsurf** | `.windsurfrules` | SYSTEM.md → `.windsurfrules` |
| **Aider** | `CONVENTIONS.md` | SYSTEM.md → `CONVENTIONS.md` |
| **Any agent** | Whatever it has | Read SYSTEM.md, run skills via shell |

## ROM vs RAM: Teaching Agents, Not Prompting Them

Most people prompt agents. Canopy **teaches** them.

The difference is ROM vs RAM:

| | RAM (Prompting) | ROM (Canopy) |
|---|---|---|
| **Where** | Context window | Workspace files |
| **Lifespan** | Dies when conversation ends | Persists forever |
| **Grows** | No — same prompt every time | Yes — agent gets smarter over time |
| **Transferable** | No — stuck in one chat | Yes — any agent reads the same files |
| **Auditable** | No — buried in conversation | Yes — version controlled, diffable |

**RAM** is the conversation context. It's temporary. When the window fills up, it's gone.
You're renting the agent's attention.

**ROM** is the workspace. Skills, agents, reference docs, workflows, playbooks, decision
trees. It's permanent. The agent loads it on boot, uses it during execution, and the
knowledge survives across sessions, across runtimes, across teams.

When you write a skill like `/qualify` with MEDDPICC scoring criteria — that's ROM.
Every agent that enters the workspace inherits it. You taught it once.

### What This Means in Practice

**Computer Use Workflows** — Need an agent to navigate a browser, fill forms, extract
data from a dashboard? Write a workflow skill. The agent reads the steps, executes them,
and the workflow persists as ROM. Next time, any agent can run it without being re-taught.

```
skills/
├── scrape-leads/SKILL.md        Agent navigates LinkedIn, extracts ICP matches
├── fill-crm/SKILL.md            Agent opens HubSpot, creates deal records
├── screenshot-audit/SKILL.md    Agent captures competitor pages, runs analysis
```

**RPA (Robotic Process Automation)** — Traditional RPA tools are brittle scripts.
Canopy workflows are natural language instructions that agents interpret with context.
When the UI changes, the agent adapts. When the process evolves, you edit a markdown file.

**Dynamic Workflows** — Workflows that branch based on context. A `/triage` skill might
route to `/escalate`, `/resolve`, or `/delegate` depending on what it finds. Skills call
other skills. Agents spawn other agents. The workspace is a living system, not a static
playbook.

**Teaching Through Friction** — The learning loop (`/remember` → `/rethink`) captures
what goes wrong. Agent makes a mistake? `mix optimal.remember "always validate email
before sending"`. After enough observations accumulate, `/rethink` synthesizes them
into updated skills or reference docs. The workspace evolves.

### The Knowledge Compound Effect

Every skill you write, every workflow you define, every reference doc you add — it
compounds. Day 1, your workspace has 10 skills. Day 30, it has 50. Day 90, the agent
operating inside it is functionally an expert in your domain.

This is why Canopy isn't a chatbot wrapper. It's an **operating system for agent
intelligence**. The workspace IS the intelligence. The agent is just the runtime.

## Why Canopy Beats Everything Else

### Others Have Tried This

A few projects have taken a run at agent orchestration — Paperclip (server-based
zero-human companies), ClawTeam (CLI swarm intelligence), Ars Contexta (knowledge
management via Claude Code), agency-agents (150+ agent library). They all got
pieces right. None got the whole thing.

| | Typical Agent Frameworks | Canopy |
|---|---|---|
| **Requires** | Server + DB + UI | A folder |
| **Templates** | Usually "coming soon" | 159 agents, 83 skills, 5 operations |
| **Context mgmt** | Flat prompt injection | L0-L3 tiered loading |
| **Classification** | None | Signal Theory auto-routing |
| **Knowledge** | None | 6R pipeline, knowledge graph, learning loop |
| **Runtimes** | 1-6 | 10+ |
| **Use cases** | One paradigm | Companies, second brains, dev, content, automation, RPA |
| **Portability** | Vendor-locked | Any agent, any machine, any VM |

### The Synthesis

No single system had all the pieces. Canopy synthesized the best ideas from across
the ecosystem:

```
Heartbeat Protocol   — Scheduled autonomous agent execution with atomic task checkout
Adapter Registry     — Pluggable runtime connectors behind a standard interface
Budget Enforcement   — 3-tier cost control (visibility → soft alert → hard ceiling)
6R Pipeline          — Record → Reduce → Reflect → Reweave → Verify → Rethink
Three-Space Model    — Self (identity) + Knowledge (graph) + Ops (ephemeral)
Tiered Loading       — L0/L1/L2/L3 context hierarchy, 96% cost reduction
Signal Theory        — S=(M,G,T,F,W) classification + auto-routing + quality gates
Simulation Engine    — Monte Carlo scenario planning + impact analysis
Agent Library        — 159 agents, 83 skills, 5 ready-to-run operations
Team Templates       — Filesystem-as-DB, inbox messaging, worktree isolation
```

**Protocol-based orchestration.** Works with any agent runtime. Requires zero
infrastructure. Deeper context management, knowledge processing, and quality
control than any server-based alternative.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/Miosa-osa/canopy.git
cd canopy

# Run a workspace
cd operations/sales-engine
# Your agent reads SYSTEM.md and starts working

# Build your own
cp -r templates/small/ my-workspace/
# Edit SYSTEM.md, add agents/, skills/, reference/

# Run a company
cp -r templates/enterprise/ my-company/
# Configure company.yaml, add workspace pointers
# Install: ../scripts/install.sh --tool claude-code
```

Each workspace is a complete AI system in a folder.
Same protocol. Different domain. Different depth.

**The workspace is the product.** The agent is just the runtime.

## Canopy + MIOSA

Canopy is the **protocol**. [MIOSA](https://github.com/Miosa-osa) is the **platform**.

You can run Canopy anywhere — your laptop, a server, a Raspberry Pi. It's just folders.
But when you want managed infrastructure, MIOSA gives you:

- **Virtual machines on demand** — Each workspace gets its own Firecracker microVM.
  Isolated, secure, disposable. Spin up a sales engine in seconds, tear it down when done.
- **Agent marketplace** — Browse, download, and install workspaces. Like an app store
  for AI agent systems. Community-built, version-controlled, one-click deploy.
- **Autonomous operation** — Agents running on heartbeats 24/7 inside managed VMs.
  You set the budget, governance rules, and goals. MIOSA handles uptime, monitoring,
  and cost tracking.
- **Team & multi-tenant** — Multiple people, multiple workspaces, shared governance.
  Your agency runs 50 client workspaces. Each client gets their own isolated VM with
  their own Canopy workspace, their own budget, their own agents.
- **Application integrations** — CRM, email, Slack, calendars, payment processors,
  databases. Canopy skills talk to external systems. MIOSA provides the connectors
  and manages the credentials.

### How It Works

```
Your laptop (local development):
  canopy/sales-engine/     ← Edit skills, test workflows, iterate fast

MIOSA platform (production):
  VM 1: sales-engine/      ← 5 agents, heartbeat every 15min, $500/mo budget
  VM 2: dev-shop/          ← 6 agents, CI/CD integration, auto-deploy
  VM 3: content-factory/   ← 5 agents, publishing pipeline, social scheduling
  VM 4: client-workspace/  ← Isolated tenant, custom agents, client-specific ROM
```

Build locally. Deploy to MIOSA. Or don't — Canopy works fine without it.

**Canopy is free forever.** MIOSA is where the business model lives — managed
infrastructure, marketplace revenue share, enterprise features. The protocol stays
open. The platform adds value on top.
