# Agent Design Guide

> How to write effective agent definitions for OSA Operations.

---

## Agent Definition Format

Every agent is a single markdown file with two parts:

1. **YAML frontmatter** -- Machine-readable metadata (organizational, budget, signal encoding)
2. **Markdown body** -- The system prompt injected when the agent activates (8 required sections)

### YAML Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: Code Reviewer
id: code-reviewer
role: reviewer
title: Senior Code Reviewer
reportsTo: tech-lead
budget: 600
color: "#2E8B57"
emoji: "\U0001F50D"
adapter: osa
signal: S=(linguistic, report, inform, markdown, review-checklist)
tools: [read, write, edit, search, bash]
skills: [code-review, lint]
context_tier: l1
---
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Human-readable agent name |
| `id` | Yes | Machine identifier (kebab-case, unique within operation) |
| `role` | Yes | Functional role (maps to workflow phase ownership) |
| `title` | Yes | Job title for org chart display |
| `reportsTo` | Yes | ID of manager agent (or `board` for top-level) |
| `budget` | Yes | Monthly USD budget for this agent |
| `color` | No | Hex color for UI display |
| `emoji` | No | Display emoji |
| `adapter` | Yes | Runtime adapter: `osa`, `claude-code`, `cursor`, `http` |
| `signal` | Yes | Default signal encoding: S=(M, G, T, F, W) |
| `tools` | Yes | List of tools this agent can use |
| `skills` | Yes | List of skill slugs this agent can invoke (from `skills/` directory) |
| `context_tier` | No | Default context loading tier: `l0`, `l1`, `full` |

### The 8 Body Sections

Every agent markdown body MUST contain these 8 sections:

```markdown
# Identity & Memory
Who this agent is, their personality, what they remember.

# Core Mission
Numbered list of 3-7 primary responsibilities.

# Critical Rules
NEVER/ALWAYS rules that constrain agent behavior.

# Process / Methodology
How the agent works -- frameworks, decision trees, reference tables.

# Skills
Which skills this agent activates and when each is used.

| Skill | When |
|-------|------|
| `/review` | On every PR before merge |
| `/lint` | After writing any code |

# Deliverable Templates
Markdown templates for the agent's primary outputs.

# Communication Style
Tone, default genre, receiver calibration.

# Success Metrics
How to measure whether this agent is performing.
```

---

## Designing Effective Agent Personalities

A good agent personality is not about being creative with adjectives. It is about
encoding the behavioral constraints that make the agent useful.

### The Three Personality Levers

**1. Domain expertise** -- What does this agent know deeply?

Bad: "You are an expert in everything related to software."
Good: "You think in bounded contexts, trade-off matrices, and architectural decision records."

**2. Behavioral constraints** -- What does this agent refuse to do?

Bad: "Be helpful and thorough."
Good: "NEVER engage in architecture astronautics -- every abstraction must justify its complexity."

**3. Decision framework** -- How does this agent make choices?

Bad: "Make good decisions."
Good: "Prefer reversible decisions over 'optimal' ones. When two approaches are close, choose the simpler one."

### Identity & Memory Section

This section establishes the agent's persona. Write it in second person ("You are...").
Include:

- **Role**: One-line functional description
- **Personality**: 3-5 adjectives that constrain behavior (not decorate it)
- **Memory**: What patterns this agent retains across sessions
- **Experience**: What this agent has "seen" that shapes its judgment

```markdown
# Identity & Memory

You are **Outbound Prospector**, a senior outbound sales specialist who builds
pipeline through signal-based prospecting and precision multi-channel sequences.
You believe outreach should be triggered by evidence, not quotas.

- **Role**: Signal-based outbound strategist and sequence architect
- **Personality**: Sharp, data-driven, allergic to generic outreach
- **Memory**: You remember which signal types, channels, and messaging angles
  produce pipeline for specific ICPs
- **Experience**: You've watched the inbox enforcement era kill lazy outbound,
  and you've thrived because you adapted to relevance-first selling
```

### Critical Rules Section

Rules are the most important part of the agent definition. They prevent failure modes.
Write them as NEVER/ALWAYS constraints:

```markdown
# Critical Rules

- NEVER send outreach without a reason the buyer should care right now
- NEVER use "just checking in" as an outreach angle
- ALWAYS document what works -- a playbook in one rep's head is not a playbook
- ALWAYS test one variable at a time
- ALWAYS respect opt-outs immediately and completely
```

Rules should be:
- **Specific** -- "NEVER automate what should be personal" not "Be thoughtful"
- **Actionable** -- The agent can evaluate compliance in any situation
- **Derived from failure modes** -- Each rule prevents a known mistake

---

## Budget and Adapter Configuration

### Budget

The `budget` field in YAML sets the monthly USD ceiling for this agent. When the
agent's cumulative token costs exceed this amount, the heartbeat system auto-pauses
the agent and notifies the board.

```yaml
budget: 800  # $800/month ceiling
```

Budget guidance by agent complexity:

| Agent Type | Typical Budget | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Utility (formatter, linter) | $100-300 | Few invocations, small context |
| Specialist (reviewer, QA) | $400-800 | Regular invocations, medium context |
| Lead (tech-lead, director) | $800-1500 | Frequent invocations, large context, orchestration |

### Adapter

The `adapter` field determines which runtime executes this agent:

| Adapter | When to Use |
|---------|------------|
| `osa` | Full protocol support -- heartbeat, sessions, budget enforcement |
| `claude-code` | Running inside Claude Code as behavioral mode |
| `cursor` | Running inside Cursor as agent rule |
| `http` | Custom runtime that speaks HTTP |

### Tools

The `tools` list defines what this agent can do:

```yaml
tools: [read, write, edit, search, bash, web-search]
```

Common tool sets:

| Agent Type | Tools |
|-----------|-------|
| Analyst / Researcher | `[read, search, web-search]` |
| Developer | `[read, write, edit, search, bash]` |
| Writer / Content | `[read, write, edit, search, web-search]` |
| Orchestrator | `[read, write, edit, search, bash, web-search]` |

---

## Connecting Agents to Skills

Skills are an agent's executable capabilities -- they define what an agent can **DO**, not just who it **IS**.

### The Three-Layer Model

```
Agent identity      → frontmatter (who this agent is, what it costs, how it encodes output)
Agent methodology   → body sections (how this agent thinks and decides)
Agent capabilities  → skills (what this agent can execute)
```

All three layers are required. An agent without declared skills is like a developer without a toolchain: the identity and methodology exist, but there is no executable capability the system can invoke.

### How Skills Connect

**`skills` frontmatter field** -- declares which skills this agent is authorized to invoke:

```yaml
skills: [code-review, lint]
```

This is machine-readable. The orchestrator reads this field to know what the agent can do before routing work to it.

**Skills body section** -- maps each declared skill to its activation context:

```markdown
# Skills

| Skill | When |
|-------|------|
| `code-review` | On every PR before merging to main |
| `lint` | After writing or modifying any code file |
```

This is human-readable methodology. It tells the agent (and any reader) under what conditions each skill fires.

**At runtime** -- the agent reads `skills/{slug}/SKILL.md` and follows the Process section of that skill definition. The skill file is the contract; the agent body declares when to invoke it.

See [skill-design.md](skill-design.md) for guidance on writing skill definitions that agents invoke.

### Example: Code Reviewer Agent

Frontmatter:
```yaml
skills: [code-review, lint]
```

Body Skills section:
```markdown
# Skills

| Skill | When |
|-------|------|
| `code-review` | Every PR opened against main or release branches |
| `lint` | Any file modified during review if lint errors are detected |
```

The agent does not re-implement the review logic in its body. It delegates to `skills/code-review/SKILL.md`. The body only records *when* to delegate.

### Why This Separation Matters

- **Reuse**: The same `code-review` skill can be declared by Code Reviewer, Tech Lead, and QA Engineer -- each with different activation triggers, same execution contract.
- **Discoverability**: The orchestrator can query which agents have a given skill without reading every agent body.
- **Auditability**: Removing a skill from `skills/` immediately surfaces all agents that declared it -- broken references, not silent omissions.

## Signal Theory Integration

Every agent carries a default signal encoding:

```yaml
signal: S=(linguistic, spec, commit, markdown, adr-template)
```

This encodes the 5 dimensions of every output the agent produces:

| Dimension | What It Resolves | Example Values |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **M** (Mode) | How is it perceived? | linguistic, visual, code, data, mixed |
| **G** (Genre) | What form does it take? | spec, brief, report, proposal, plan, note |
| **T** (Type) | What does it do? | direct, inform, commit, decide, express |
| **F** (Format) | What container? | markdown, code, JSON, yaml, HTML |
| **W** (Structure) | Internal skeleton? | adr-template, review-checklist, meddpicc-scorecard |

### How to Choose the Right Signal

Match the signal to the agent's primary receiver:

| Receiver | Preferred Genre | Example Signal |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Developers | spec | S=(code, spec, commit, markdown, component-architecture) |
| Salespeople | brief | S=(linguistic, brief, direct, markdown, persuasion) |
| Executives | report | S=(data, report, inform, markdown, executive-dashboard) |
| Other agents | spec or report | S=(linguistic, report, inform, markdown, handoff-template) |

### Overriding Per-Deliverable

The frontmatter signal is the default. Agents can override for specific deliverables
in their Deliverable Templates section:

```markdown
### Template: Executive Summary
> Signal override: S=(linguistic, brief, inform, markdown, executive-summary)

### Template: Architecture Decision Record
> Signal override: S=(linguistic, spec, commit, markdown, adr-template)
```

## Examples

### Simple Agent: Bug Triager

A lightweight agent that classifies incoming bug reports.

```yaml
---
name: Bug Triager
id: bug-triager
role: triager
title: Bug Triage Specialist
reportsTo: tech-lead
budget: 200
adapter: osa
signal: S=(linguistic, report, decide, markdown, triage-template)
tools: [read, search]
skills: [triage]
context_tier: l0
---

# Identity & Memory

You are **Bug Triager**, a specialist who classifies incoming bug reports by severity,
component, and likely root cause. You are fast, decisive, and never block the queue.

- **Role**: Bug report classification and routing
- **Personality**: Decisive, systematic, zero tolerance for vague reports
- **Memory**: You track recurring bug patterns and component failure rates
- **Experience**: You've triaged thousands of reports and can spot duplicates instantly

# Core Mission

1. **Classify severity** -- P0 (production down) through P3 (cosmetic)
2. **Identify component** -- Which service/module is affected
3. **Detect duplicates** -- Link to existing issues when the bug is already known
4. **Route to owner** -- Assign to the right developer based on component ownership
5. **Request missing info** -- If the report is incomplete, ask for reproduction steps

# Critical Rules

- NEVER assign P0 without confirming production impact
- NEVER close a report as duplicate without linking the original
- ALWAYS request reproduction steps if not provided
- ALWAYS tag reports with affected component within 5 minutes

# Process / Methodology

| Severity | Criteria | SLA |
|----------|----------|-----|
| P0 | Production down, data loss, security breach | 15 min response |
| P1 | Major feature broken, workaround exists | 2 hour response |
| P2 | Minor feature broken, low-impact workaround | 24 hour response |
| P3 | Cosmetic, documentation, nice-to-have | Next sprint |

# Skills

| Skill | When |
|-------|------|
| `triage` | On every incoming bug report before assigning severity |

# Deliverable Templates

### Template: Triage Report
- **Severity**: P{0-3}
- **Component**: {component}
- **Duplicate of**: {link or "New"}
- **Assigned to**: {agent-id}
- **Missing info**: {what's needed or "Complete"}

# Communication Style

- **Tone**: Direct, factual, zero filler
- **Default genre**: report
- **Receiver calibration**: Developers want severity + component + repro steps. Nothing else.

# Success Metrics

- Triage time: under 5 minutes per report
- Correct severity assignment: 95%+
- Duplicate detection rate: 90%+
- Zero P0s left unassigned for more than 15 minutes
```

### Complex Agent: Deal Strategist

A heavyweight agent with rich methodology and multiple deliverable types.

```yaml
---
name: Deal Strategist
id: deal-strategist
role: strategist
title: VP of Sales
reportsTo: board
budget: 1200
adapter: osa
signal: S=(linguistic, report, decide, markdown, meddpicc-scorecard)
tools: [read, write, edit, search, web-search]
context_tier: l1
---
```

See `agents/sales/deal-strategist.md` for the full body -- it includes MEDDPICC
methodology, account tiering frameworks, pipeline review processes, and multiple
deliverable templates (forecast reports, deal reviews, coaching sessions).

### Proactive Agent: Health Monitor

An agent that self-activates on schedule to check system health.

```yaml
---
name: Health Monitor
id: health-monitor
role: monitor
title: System Health Monitor
reportsTo: tech-lead
budget: 300
adapter: osa
signal: S=(data, report, inform, markdown, health-dashboard)
tools: [read, search, bash]
context_tier: l0
---
```

See [Proactive Agents](proactive-agents.md) for the full pattern on self-activating agents.

---

## Agents Within Teams

Individual agents are the nodes; teams are the structure that makes a group of agents a functioning organization.

### How reportsTo Builds the Org Chart

The `reportsTo` field in an agent's YAML frontmatter is what places that agent in the hierarchy. Every agent must declare who it reports to -- either another agent's `id` or `board` for top-level agents. This chain determines escalation paths, delegation authority, and review authority.

```yaml
reportsTo: tech-lead   # Reports to the tech-lead agent
reportsTo: board       # Top-level -- reports directly to the human operator
```

On its own, the `reportsTo` chain produces an org chart. It routes escalations but does not define how agents coordinate on shared work.

### Teams as Coordination Units

Teams group agents into a named unit with a shared budget ceiling, a common mission, and defined coordination patterns. A team manifest lives in `teams/{team-id}.md` and establishes:

- Which agents are members
- The team's collective budget envelope
- Handoff patterns between members (e.g., developer → reviewer → deploy)
- Escalation rules within the team
- The manager agent accountable for team output

See [`protocol/team-format.md`](../protocol/team-format.md) for the full team manifest schema and coordination pattern examples.

### Agents, Projects, and Tasks

Agents are not just organizational nodes -- they are assigned to work. Agents receive task assignments that reference projects in the goal hierarchy:

- **Projects** (`projects/{project-id}/PROJECT.md`) define bounded workstreams with milestones and evidence gates. An agent owner is named on each project.
- **Tasks** (`tasks/` and `tasks/manifests/`) are the atomic units assigned to individual agents. Ephemeral tasks are created at runtime; task manifests are reusable definitions for recurring work.

This means an agent can simultaneously:
- Belong to a team (organizational placement via `reportsTo`)
- Own a project (accountable for a workstream)
- Be assigned tasks (executing atomic units of work)

For the project file format, see [`protocol/project-format.md`](../protocol/project-format.md).
For the task manifest format, see [`protocol/task-format.md`](../protocol/task-format.md).

## Common Mistakes and Anti-Patterns

### 1. Vague Identity

Bad:
```markdown
You are an AI assistant that helps with code.
```

Good:
```markdown
You are **Code Reviewer**, a senior engineer who reads code like a forensic
accountant reads financial statements -- looking for what's wrong, what's missing,
and what will break at 3am.
```

### 2. No Critical Rules

Without NEVER/ALWAYS constraints, agents drift. Every agent needs at least 3 rules
that prevent its most dangerous failure modes.

### 3. Missing Process Section

The Process section is where methodology lives. An agent without a process section
is just a personality -- it has opinions but no framework for applying them.

### 4. Wrong Signal Encoding

If your agent produces specs but is encoded as `brief`, the output will constantly
mismatch what receivers expect. Match the signal to the actual output genre.

### 5. Overly Broad Tools

Giving every agent `[read, write, edit, search, bash, web-search]` is like giving
every employee admin access. A researcher does not need `write`. A triager does
not need `bash`. Constrain tools to what the role requires.

### 6. No Success Metrics

Without metrics, you cannot tell if the agent is performing. Every agent needs
2-5 measurable indicators that map to its core mission.

### 7. Personality Without Constraints

"Creative, enthusiastic, and passionate" tells the agent nothing about how to behave.
Personality adjectives should constrain: "data-driven" means lead with numbers.
"Allergic to generic outreach" means reject template-based messaging.

### 8. No Skills Declaration

Agents that can invoke skills but don't declare them are invisible to the orchestrator.
The frontmatter `skills` field is how the system knows what an agent can DO, not just
who it IS. An agent that silently invokes skills it hasn't declared breaks discoverability,
auditability, and routing. If an agent uses a skill, declare it -- in frontmatter and in
the body Skills section.
